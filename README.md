The Library Management System is a relational database designed to streamline the tracking of books, members, librarians, and borrowing activity within a library. It consists of several interconnected tables: `Members` to store borrower information, `Books` to manage book details and availability, `Librarians` to log staff involvement, and `BorrowRecords` to track when books are borrowed and returned. Additionally, the system uses `Categories` and `BookCategories` tables to classify books under multiple genres using a many-to-many relationship. With proper use of primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints like `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE`, this system ensures data integrity, eliminates redundancy, and allows for efficient management of library operations.
